[features]
# Configure the library to use a reference counted I2C bus object rather than moving the I2C bus
# object into the MCP230xx struct. This allows the I2C bus to be shared between multiple clients. Using this
# feature does change the API slightly, as the I2C bus object must be passed wrapped in an `&Rc<RefCell<...>>` to the
# `new` function.
